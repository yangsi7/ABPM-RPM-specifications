## Critical Insights & Improvements Needed

### 1. Notification Architecture Gap
The current design doesn't fully address the notification challenge mentioned in clarifications. We need:
- Unified notification service design
- Priority/severity matrix for ABPM vs Holter alerts  
- Notification deduplication strategy
- Mobile push notification integration

### 2. Performance Optimization Strategy
Add these elements:
```typescript
// Caching strategy for RPM dashboard
interface CacheStrategy {
  dashboardTTL: 60, // seconds
  studyDataTTL: 300, // 5 minutes
  invalidateOn: ['STUDY_UPDATE', 'NEW_READING'],
  prefetch: ['activeStudies', 'recentReadings']
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
Current mockups show error states but need:
- Retry strategies with exponential backoff
- Offline queue for SCLA app
- Partial sync recovery mechanisms
- Admin tools for manual intervention

### 4. Missing Architectural Components

#### A. Notification Aggregator Service
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│   Notification Aggregator   │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ • Deduplicate alerts        │
│ • Priority scoring          │
│ • Channel routing           │
│ • Delivery tracking         │
└─────────────────────────────┘
        ↑            ↑
   Holter Events  ABPM Events
```

#### B. Study Factory Pattern
```typescript
class StudyFactory {
  static create(type: StudyType, config: StudyConfig): Study {
    const registry = {
      HOLTER: HolterStudy,
      ABPM: ABPMStudy,
      SCALE: ScaleStudy
    };
    return new registry[type](config);
  }
}
```

### 5. Security Enhancements Needed

1. **Device Pairing Security**:
   - Time-limited pairing tokens
   - Device fingerprinting
   - Encrypted BLE communication

2. **iframe Security Headers**:
   ```javascript
   Content-Security-Policy: 
     frame-src https://sphygmo.com; 
     frame-ancestors https://mvcp.myant.ca
   ```

3. **API Rate Limiting**:
   - Per-patient sync limits
   - Bulk operation throttling
   - DDoS protection

## Recommendations for Phase 3

### Immediate Actions
1. **Create Notification Architecture**: Design unified alerting system
2. **Performance Test Plan**: Load test iframe integration
3. **Security Audit**: Review all integration points
4. **Accessibility Audit**: Add ARIA labels to mockups

### Technical Spikes Needed
1. **Sphygmo API Testing**: Validate assumptions about available endpoints
2. **PostMessage Performance**: Measure latency and optimize
3. **Event Bus Selection**: Kafka vs EventBridge vs Redis Streams
4. **Mobile Sync Strategy**: Test offline-first architecture

### Documentation Gaps
1. **API Contract Specifications**: Define all MVCP↔Sphygmo APIs
2. **Error Code Registry**: Standardize error handling
3. **Deployment Guide**: Multi-system coordination
4. **Runbook**: Operational procedures for common issues

## Quality Metrics to Track

### Development Metrics
- **Code Coverage**: Target >80% for new code
- **API Response Time**: <200ms p95 for sync operations
- **Sync Reliability**: >99.9% successful synchronization
- **UI Performance**: <100ms interaction delay

### Business Metrics
- **Study Creation Time**: <30 seconds for ABPM setup
- **Data Availability**: <5 minute lag for BP readings
- **User Satisfaction**: >4.5/5 for ABPM workflow
- **Support Tickets**: <5% increase with new features

## Architectural Risks to Monitor

1. **Sphygmo Availability**: Single point of failure for ABPM visualization
   - Mitigation: Fallback to basic charts if iframe fails
   
2. **Event Bus Scalability**: May bottleneck with high volume
   - Mitigation: Implement backpressure and partitioning
   
3. **ID Mapping Complexity**: Grows with each new system
   - Mitigation: Consider identity federation service
   
4. **Mobile Sync Reliability**: Network dependencies
   - Mitigation: Robust offline queue with conflict resolution

## Final Assessment

**Overall Architecture Score**: 7.6/10

The proposed architecture is sound and addresses the core requirements effectively. The event-driven approach with polymorphic studies and iframe integration provides a pragmatic path forward. However, several areas need refinement before moving to implementation:

1. **Strengthen** notification architecture
2. **Define** performance optimization strategies  
3. **Enhance** security specifications
4. **Complete** API contract definitions
5. **Add** operational runbooks

The ASCII mockups effectively communicate the user experience and will accelerate design team productivity. The separation of concerns between MVCP, SCLA, and Sphygmo is well-thought-out and maintains system boundaries while enabling integration.

## Conclusion

Phase 2 successfully translates requirements into actionable architecture. The recommended solutions balance technical excellence with practical constraints. With the identified improvements, this architecture will support not just ABPM integration but future RPM expansions while maintaining system quality and user experience.
