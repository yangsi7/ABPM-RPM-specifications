# Conventions - ABPM Integration Architecture

## Architectural Patterns & Standards

### 1. Integration Patterns

#### Event-Driven Architecture
- Use event sourcing for cross-system synchronization
- Implement event bus for loose coupling
- Design for eventual consistency
- Include retry and dead letter queue patterns

#### API Design
- RESTful APIs with OpenAPI 3.0 specifications
- GraphQL for complex data fetching requirements
- Consistent error handling and status codes
- Versioning strategy for backward compatibility

#### Security Patterns
- OAuth 2.0 / OIDC for authentication
- JWT tokens with proper expiration
- API Gateway for centralized security
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data

### 2. Data Synchronization Conventions

#### Identity Management
- Single source of truth principle
- UUID-based identifiers across systems
- Mapping tables for legacy ID translation
- Audit trail for all identity operations

#### Sync Strategies
- Push-based for real-time requirements
- Pull-based for batch operations
- Conflict resolution protocols defined
- Data consistency validation

### 3. Documentation Standards

#### Architectural Artifacts
- Use C4 model for system diagrams
- Mermaid for inline diagrams
- Draw.io for complex visualizations
- Always include legend and context

#### Writing Style
- Clear, concise technical writing
- Active voice preferred
- Bullet points for lists
- Tables for comparisons

### 4. Solution Evaluation Criteria

#### Scoring Matrix
| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Impact | 40% | Business value delivered |
| Effort | 30% | Development complexity |
| Risk | 20% | Technical and operational risks |
| Maintainability | 10% | Long-term support costs |

### 5. File Naming Conventions

#### Deliverables
- UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES for primary deliverables
- PascalCase for supporting documents
- kebab-case for web resources
- ISO 8601 dates (YYYY-MM-DD) when needed

#### Version Control
- Semantic versioning for APIs
- Date-based versioning for documents
- Git tags for major milestones

### 6. Communication Protocols

#### Stakeholder Updates
- Weekly progress reports
- Risk escalation within 24 hours
- Decision logs maintained
- Assumption documentation

#### Technical Reviews
- Peer review for all deliverables
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Trade-off analysis documentation

### 7. Quality Standards

#### Completeness
- No placeholders or TODOs in deliverables
- Self-contained documents
- All diagrams have captions
- References properly cited

#### Consistency
- Terminology aligned with glossary
- Formatting matches templates
- Cross-references verified
- No contradictions between documents
